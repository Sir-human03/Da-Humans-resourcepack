This is a custom resource pack made specifically for the Da Humans server.

It adds custom cosmetic textures and models, including multiple top hats, a Christmas hat, and the Master Sword and Hylian Shield. New models may be added from time to time as I make them. All models are purely visual and do not affect gameplay.

Da Humans resouce pack is intended to be used with *ModelApplier by ewanhowell5195. Without it, you will not be able to see the models in-game
